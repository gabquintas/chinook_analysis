# Chinook SQL Analysis

This project was part of Udacity's Data Science Foundations II project.

For this project, I've used Jupyter Notebook, selected Python packages and SQLite to access a relational database, explore it and draw conclusions. The relational database schema, as well as the entire exploratory process, is described in the Jupyter Notebook. Only descriptive statistics was used in this project.
